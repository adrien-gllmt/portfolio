# PORTFOLIO V2

I believe there's not much to say... Here's the source code from the V2 of my portfolio, using [React](https://fr.reactjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://fr.reactjs.org).

For now this page is only available in french, but I may someday translate it.

I sure don't need to document it as it's for my personal use and there's no 'interactions'.
Maybe the V3 will be documented as I planned to create a headless CMS in order to post some articles, so you could use it as a template for your own one.
